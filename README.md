# xfade-easing

## Overview

XFade is a video cross fade filter for FFmpeg, providing many transitions including a way for users to code their own custom effects.

This project is a port of Robert Pennerâ€™s easing equations for the FFmpeg expression evaluator, for custom xfade transitions.

It also ports most xfade transitions, some GL Transitions and other transitions, for use in tandem with the easing expressions.

**Example**: wipedown with cubic easing:

![wipedown-cubic](https://github.com/scriptituk/xfade-easing/assets/35268161/7eb6ff12-41a0-48ba-945c-fcd828cd03b1)
```
ffmpeg -i first.mp4 -i second.mp4 -filter_complex_threads 1 -filter_complex \
       xfade=duration=3:offset=1:transition=custom:expr="'
           st(0, 1 - P); st(1, if(gt(P, 0.5), 4 * ld(0)^3, 1 - 4 * P^3)); st(0, 1 - ld(1))
           ;
           if(gt(Y, H * (1 - ld(0))), A, B)
       '" output.mp4
```
The `expr` is shown on three lines. The first line is the easing expression $e(P)$ (cubic in-out) which stores its calculated progress value in `st(0)`; the third line is the  transition expression $t(e(P))$ (wipedown) which loads its eased progress value from `ld(0)` instead of $P$; the second line, a semicolon, separates the easing and transition expressions for clarity.

> [!NOTE]  
> the example appears overly complicated because xfade progress `P` goes from 1..0 but the easing equations expect 0..1

> [!WARNING] 
> the `-filter_complex_threads 1` ffmpeg option is required because xfade expressions are not thread-safe (the st() & ld() functions use xfade context memory)

### GL Transitions
	gl_crosswarp  
	gl_directionalwarp [args: smoothness,direction.x,direction.y default: =0.1,-1,1]  
	gl_multiply_blend  
	gl_pinwheel [args: speed default: =2]

	gl_Swirl  
	gl_WaterDrop [args: amplitude,speed default: =30,30]
#### Parameters
Some GL Transitions accept parameters, appended to the transition name as CSV.  
**Example**: 2 pinwheel speeds using `-t gl_pinwheel=1` & `-t gl_pinwheel=10`  
![gl_pinwheel-speed1](https://github.com/scriptituk/xfade-easing/assets/35268161/a256ce01-009a-4884-afeb-0cf9936b76ea)
![gl_pinwheel-speed10](https://github.com/scriptituk/xfade-easing/assets/35268161/06505e2e-3944-43e9-9312-b058c0883b09)
### Other transitions
	x_screen_blend  
	x_overlay_blend
## Expr code generator CLI script
xfade-easing.sh is a Bash 4 script that generates the custom easing and transition expressions for the xfade `expr` parameter.

It can also generate easing graphs via gnuplot and demo videos for testing.
### Usage
```
FFmpeg XFade Easing script (xfade-easing version 1.0) by Raymond Luckhurst, scriptit.uk
Generates custom xfade expressions for the xfade filter for transitions with easing.
See https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#xfade & https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Xfade
Usage: xfade-easing.sh [options]
Options:
    -f pixel format (default: rgb24): use ffmpeg -pix_fmts for list
    -t transition name (default: fade): use -L for list
    -e easing function (default: linear; standard Robert Penner easing functions):
       see -L for list
    -m easing mode (default: inout): in out inout
    -x expr output filename (default: no expr), accepts expansions
    -a append to expr output file
    -s expr output format string (default: '%x')
       %t expands to the transition name; %e easing name; %m easing mode
       %T, %E, %M upper case expansions of above
       %x expands to the generated expr, compact, best for inline filterchains
       %X does too but is more legible, good for filter_complex_script files
       %y expands to the easing expression, compact; %Y legible
       %z expands to the transition expression, compact; %Z legible
       %n inserts a newline
    -p easing plot output filename (default: no plot)
       accepts expansions but %m/%M is pointless as plots show all easing modes
       formats: gif, jpg, png, svg, eps, html <canvas>, determined from file extension
    -c canvas size for easing plot (default: 640x480, scaled to inches for EPS)
       format: WxH; omitting W or H scales to ratio 4:3, e.g -z x300 scales W
    -v video output filename (default: no video), accepts expansions
       formats: gif, mp4 (x264 yuv420p), determined from file extension
    -z video size (default: 250x200)
       format: WxH; omitting W or H scales to ratio 5:4, e.g -z 300x scales H
    -l video length (default: 5)
    -d video transition duration (default: 3)
    -r video framerate (default: 25)
    -n show effect name on video as text
    -2 stack uneased and eased videos horizontally (h), vertically (v) or auto (a)
       auto selects the orientation that displays the easing to best effect
       stacking nly works for non-linear easings (default: no stack)
    -L list all transitions and easings
    -H show this usage text
Notes:
    1. point the shebang path to a bash4 location (defaults to MacPorts install)
    2. this script requires Bash 4 (2009), gawk, gsed, envsubst, ffmpeg, gnuplot, base64
    3. use -filter_complex_threads 1 ffmpeg option (slower!) because xfade expressions
       are not thread-safe (the st() & ld() functions use contextual allocation)
    4. certain xfade transitions are not implemented because they perform aggregation
       (distance, fadegrays, hblur)
    5. a few GL Transitions are also ported, some of which take parameters;
       to override the default parameters append as CSV after an = sign,
       e.g. -t gl_PolkaDotsCurtain=10,0.5,0.5 for 10 dots centred
       (see https://gl-transitions.com/gallery)
    6. many transitions do not lend themselves well to easing, and easings that overshoot
       (back & elastic) may cause weird effects!
